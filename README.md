#USER STORIES 

As a market researcher I want to be able to quantify which products have been voted on the most. 

As a market researcher I want to see the percent of times an item was picked if dit was presented as an option.

As a market researcher I want to be able to see  visually the results of the votes,in table or graph form. 

As a developer I want to write clean code, that's easy to follow when multiple functions and object are involved. 

As a developer I want to create an app with clear instructions so that the data collected can be as useful as possible. 

As a developer I want to style the survey app in a way that makes the user want to stay and take it. 

As a user I want the app the be clear and easy to use. 

As a user I want to know how long/how many vote I have left so I don't feel like the survey will never end.

As a user I want to be entertained slightly so the survey isn't really boring and I want to feel satisfied at the end fore helping a company's market research.
